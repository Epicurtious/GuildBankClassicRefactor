# GuildBankClassicRefactor
This is a refactor and update of the addon GuildBankClassic that is used in conjunction with Google Sheets to show the contents of a bank alt for a guild.

# Known Bugs/Issues
If you setup authentication with the Blizzard app, they will give you an extra 4 bag spaces in your backpack. The way the addon was written to work with google sheets is very rigid and would take a bit more effort on both the addon side and the google sheets side to add those extra 4 bag spaces. You may notice the bottom 4 items in your bag are missing from the guild bank if you have those extra slots, this is expected. I do not intend to fix this at the time, just know you will have to leave those slots empty for this to work.

If there ever comes a day where there are bags bigger then 18 slots in Classic, this addon and the google sheets page will need some work. As stated in the previous issue, the addon is very rigid in the way it was written and I do not intent to fix the design issues of the addon AND the Google Sheets document.
